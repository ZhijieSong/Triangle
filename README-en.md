## This is a renderer based on OpenGL 4.6.
## First of all, it is not a game engine, nor a modeling software, it is just a renderer, but it does not provide a standard rendering pipeline, but provides a simple rendering framework, users can customize the rendering pipeline according to their own needs.
## The renderer provides the following features:
- A renderer framework based on OpenGL 4.6.
- A shader compiler based on SPIR-V.
- Support GLSL Include.
- Model import based on Assimp.
- GUI and window tools based on ImGui.
- Management of a series of renderer resources such as Pass, Pipeline, Shader, Texture, Model, Material, Light, etc.
- Support for Shadertoy.
- A physics engine based on BepuPhysics.
